This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

**Project Steps**
**1) Set Up the Environment**
• Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
• Goal: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

**2) Set Up Kaggle API**
**API Setup: **
Obtain your Kaggle API token from Kaggle by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
**Configure Kaggle:**
Place the downloaded kaggle.json file in your local .kaggle folder.
Use the command kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to pull datasets directly into your project.
